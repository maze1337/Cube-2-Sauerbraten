# Cube-2-Sauerbraten

A simple and effective Direct3D & ImGui-based internal cheat framework designed for game hacking. This project features ESP, Aimbot, and Silent Aim functionalities, with hooks for SwapBuffers and WndProc to intercept rendering and input handling.

Features:
✅ ESP (Wallhack) – Displays player boxes, health bars, and names.
✅ Aimbot – Automatically aims at the closest enemy.
✅ Silent Aim – Modifies bullet trajectory without snapping the crosshair.
✅ ImGui Menu – Toggle cheats via an interactive UI.
✅ Hooked Rendering – Uses OpenGL & SDL2 hooks for smooth overlay.
✅ MinHook Integration – Efficient function hooking.
✅ Multi-threaded Injection – Runs as a DLL injected into the target game.
